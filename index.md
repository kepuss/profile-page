This year Identityfirst will be presenting its eKYC hub at the Identiverse conference. We are thrilled to be able to demonstrate our framework to the wider audience of identity specialists.

### Identityfirst eKYC hub
The first version of the Identityfirst eKYC hub framework was released. We managed to integrate it with Keycloak IDP. However, there is plenty of additional features that we want to add, and thus we expect next versions to be released shortly.
